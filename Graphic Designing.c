//GRAPHIC DESIGNING 
								GRAPHIC + DESIGN
 				 Graphic "visual"
art,imagination,expression
involving many medium such as drawing,painting,engraving or 
lettering giving clear and explicit detail
		"Visual elements"
1. Line
2. Color
3. Shape
4. Texture
5. Space
6. Form
7. Topography
	 Design 
to decide upon look and function of something before it is made
thinking,problem solving ,practicality 
		"Key principle of design"
1. Contrast
2. Hierarchy
3. Alignment 
4. Balance
5. Proximity
6. Repetition 
7. Simplicity
8. Function

visual element and design principle == Graphic Design
its only once we have solid idea developed through the 'design process' we can use our skiils
with visual element and creative tools to bring the idea to life
Jobs
advertising,branding,web design,interface design,magazine layout,paper engineering 
& packaging,tv/motion graphics,infographics,signage,art & intallation,digital art

				'LINE' as visual element (graphic part)
straight or curve
thick or thin
solid or dashed
 
-used to add structure to composition,to frame information and 
to divide information
-can add elegance to composition,add hierarchy and 
draw the eye to specific point
-used to emphasise and put stress to word or paragraph
-used to decorate,illustrate,and represent information in inforgraphics
ex=magazines,newspaper,MAPS one he most common visual element is line
as it works very to structure information
/* Line in Infographics
   Lines stressing a word
   Line in structure
   Dividing lines
   Lines as borders 
   Lines as decoration  */
   
				'COLOR' as visual element (graphic part)
-can give emphasis
-mechanism of organisation
-create impact and look ,feel in peice of work
Color Wheel
yellow,red,blue model consists of 12 color
	1. Primary colors 
yello,red,blue

	2. Secondary color//opp to primary color which is not mixed
secondary colors make by mixing equal portion of primary colors
orange (yello+red)  
purple (red+blue)   // opposite to Yellow
green  (blue+yellow)

	3. Tertiary color
tertiary color is made by mixing primary color with its neighbouring secondary colors
to fill the gap and form 12 color wheel

	1. Warm color of color wheel
primary color Yellow to its opp. secodary color Purple through an primary color Red
	2. Cool color of color wheel
secondary color Purple to its opp. primary color Yellow through an primary color Blue

		Wheel Alignment rules
Primary color will be covered by two tertiary color  (t,p,t)
Secondary color will be covered by one primary color and one tertiary color  (p,s,t)
Tertiary color will be covered by one primary color and one secondary color  (p,t,s)

Primary color will always be opposed by secondary color  (p,s)
Secondary color will always be opposed by primary color  (s,p)
Tertiary color will always be opposed by tertiary color  (t,t)


		"Color rules"
	1. Monochromatic color
-Monochromatic colours are shades and tints of the same colour
the monochromatic colour scheme is typically balanced and easy on the eye
-it is actually on the RADUIS OF THE COLOR WHEEL 
-it include ONE SINGLE color it can be EITHER of the primary,secondary,tertiary color

	2. Analogous color
-Analogous colours are balanced and work well together since they have similar origins
but are typically more interesting as the colours have more contrast 
as compared to monochromatic color 
-it include THREE COLOR pairs like (t,p,t) or (p,s,t) or (p,t,s) // as by color wheel alignment rulez
 
	3. Complimentary color
-These colors are found on the opposite end of color wheel
-Complimentary colours have high contrast
which produce vibrant exciting colour schemes
-Since it have high contrast BACKGROUND and TEXT COLOR can be set complimentary for increased visibility
-it include TWO COLOR pairs like (p,s) or (s,p) or (t,t)

	4. Triadic color
-Triadic color are those spaced equally on color wheel	
-It typically produce  vibrant effects
-it can include ANY color pairs which are spaced equally on the color wheel 

				'SHAPE' as visual element (graphic part)
-In design 'Shape'have two dimensions and are measured by their height and width
-Shapes are defined by boundaries, such as  a lines or colour 
and can also be created with negative space.
/* shapes as line
   shapes as color
   shapes as negative space  */

-add interest and substance to graphic design work
-used to decorate
-they can be symbolic
-can be used to create pattern and texture

	1. Geometric shapes
can be drawn by using ruler or compass
ex=rectangle,circle
whether simple or complex it produce feeling of control or order

	2. Organic shapes
shapes that are drawn free hand or shapes found in nature
whether simple or complex it produce natural feel

When we group or move shapes closer or apart we are applying Proximity
PROXIMITY (design part) plays imp role when working with shapes
-it use when there are multiple shapes irrespectively of geometric or organic symbol

/*  Group of individual shapes creating an overall shape in a composition
    build a legible image as an illustration 
    To decorate, to build and  illustrate
    To create a surface  pattern texture
    to create a surface image texture   */

				'TEXTURE' as visual element (graphic part)
-texture is way surface feels or is preceived to feel
-create visual tone
-can influence lool anf feel of work
-used to attract or repeal interest to an element depending upon pleasentness of texture
 	
 	1. Image Texture
-it is generated by combination of organic and geometeric shapes and color
-appears random to create particular look and feel
-tantalises the senses,triggers feeling of emotion and sensation of touch 
   Enviromental(wood,grain,sand,water,stones,stars,cloud)
   Biological(skin,fur,feather,lesf,animal prints)
   Man Made(painting,illustration,dies,cloths,paper,typography,photographic effects)
   
 	2. Pattern Texture
-it is generated by combination of organic and geometeric shapes and color
-mostly manufactured ,appears more structured and less abstarct
-trigger visual sense(visual recognition) rather than emotional senses
-work well as decoration

				'SPACE' as visual element (graphic part)			
-creates visual essence and dynamic of composition

	1. Positive Space
-usually refer to anything that is main focus of page
	2. Negative Space
-it is white space or empty space which is part of design that is not there
-it is actually the empty space between visual element 
-it connect and disconnect between space to suggest relationship between shapes
-avoid visual clutter and look clean
		
			Effects to create visual dynamics 
	1. Proximity 
It is simply the distance between different shapes from one another
far apart or closed together it suggest relationship between shapes
	2. Overlap 
overlap is effect where shapes are arranged to appear to be top of each other
it make look like top element is closer to observer and bottom element far from observer
	3. Opacity
opacity is effect where objects appear transparent
Degree of opacity can make element look heavy or light suggests dominance and order of closeness in space
OPACITY blurs barriers between positive space and negative space
overlapping transparent element can create dynamics in composition to create an illusion of 3-D 
	4. Light & Shadow 
it gives object  3-D look
shadow can create illusion that object is on top of another and suggest how far apart they may be
	5. Perspective / Depth
it is created through arrangement,creation, and manipulation of shapes to look like they appear in real life
it is effect where shapes seems to get smaller the further away they get
also be achieved through use of realtive size of objects,overlapping objects,blurring(opacity) and sharpening of objects
there is no way to determine the depth of space but only the order of closeness

				'FORM' as visual element (graphic part)
-Form is described as any  three-dimensional object
-Forms are the 3-D equivalents of shapes and as such are measured by their height, width, and depth. 
-it can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object and can be enhanced by tone, texture and color.
-it adds realism and depth 
-can trigger sensation of touch,rough,smooth,hard,soft,hot or cold,round or pointy

	1. Geometric form
forms that appear manmade
produce feeling of control,order and appear clean and sterile
	2. Organic form
forms that appear more natural 
produce the feeling of natural feel

				'TYPOGRAPHY' as visual element (graphic part)
TYPE is most direct way to communicate visually typically set either as headers or paragraphs
-Single letter in typeface is combination of geometric and organic shapes to create together larger shapes
for ex= single letter R is entity and is part of complete typeface PRACTICE 

		Style of word (TYPEFACE)
it express the particular look and feel to type(printed words or para)
	Categories 
-Sans Serif 
-Serif
-Slab Serif 
-Rounded
-Scrift 
-Blackletter 
-Decorative .
-Abstract

	1. Functional 
it is used to inform and delivers clear message 	
	2. Decorative
it is also used to inform information but priority is placed more on creative aspects of look and feel
